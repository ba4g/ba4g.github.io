## Preparation
### Computer requirements
You need to bring your own laptop. 

Requirements: 
* Python 3.6+
* At least 20Gb free disk-space

Desired (but not required): 
* Linux kernel system (Mac, Windows 10 or Linux based OS)

### Course book
On day 1 and 2, the course covers chapters 3 and 9 from the book ["Bioinformatics Algorithms - an active learning approach"](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/). Having these chapters at hand during the programming exercises will prove very helpful.


### Literature
On days 1,2 and 4, we will have literature review sessions. For each day we selected a small number of papers. One is a more methods oriented, while the other is a review article. You are expected to read both these papers thoroughly. For the methods paper we expect you are able to discuss the method details.

| Day | Topic | Papers | 
|------|-----------------------------|--|
| Day 1 | Assembly           | https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/14/2103/1742895/ <br> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27742661 |
| Day 2 | Indexed Alignment  | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108431/pdf/nihms-605372.pdf <br> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19451168 |
| Day 4 | Pan-genomics       | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27769991 <br> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30125266  |

## During the course

### Exercises 
Exercises for Day 1 and Day 2 of the course are hosted on Rosalind. You first need to [enroll in the course](http://rosalind.info/classes/enroll/b694ec3604/).

After you have enrolled in the course, you can also [directly access it](http://rosalind.info/classes/614/) 

Exercises for Day 4 - Pangenomics will be shared during the course.
