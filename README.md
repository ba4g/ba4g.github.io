## Preparation
### Computer requirements
You need to bring your own laptop. 

Requirements: 
* Python 3.6+
* At least 20Gb free disk-space

Desired (but not required): 
* Linux kernel system (Mac, Windows 10 or Linux based OS)

__NOTE:__ For those who are not familiar with unix shell, [click here][unix] for a quick tutorial.

### Course book
On day 1 and 2, the course covers chapters 3 and 9 from the book ["Bioinformatics Algorithms - an active learning approach"](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/). Having these chapters at hand during the programming exercises will prove very helpful.


### Literature
On days 1,2 and 4, we will have literature review sessions. For each day we selected a small number of papers. One is a more methods oriented, while the other is a review article. You are expected to read both these papers thoroughly. For the methods paper we expect you are able to discuss the method details.
You can find the list of papers we will be reading [here][lit].

## During the course

### Exercises 
Exercises for Day 1 and Day 2 of the course are hosted on Rosalind. You first need to [enroll in the course](http://rosalind.info/classes/enroll/b694ec3604/).

After you have enrolled in the course, you can also [directly access it][ex] 

Exercises for Day 4 - Pangenomics will be shared during the course.
